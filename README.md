Anydle is an improved version of the famous daily game called Wordle by the New York Times. It keeps the 5-letter word guessing system, within 6 chances but adds a clean twist – **Categories**. In addition to the standard mode, you can choose from four presets : Tech, Science and Sports. When you pick a category, all possible answers relate only to that theme, making a new fun game mode. Instead of the daily word format, Anydle has an infinite word game mode – which never ends.
